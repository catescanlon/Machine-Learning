# Machine-Learning
This is some code I've used in a project utilizing machine learning to predict age-related cognitive decline.

I've removed file names, as well as any actual files to protect the data of our participants. In this repo,
you'll find code on running machine learning classifiers, regressors, as well as some data characterizations, all using pandas dataframes.
All column names are in reference to a private data file.
